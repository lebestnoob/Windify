# The Status of Windify

## This website is no longer maintained. This may mean the website may break in the future. You can access this website at [https://windify.netlify.app/](https://windify.netlify.app/)

### Why is it here?

Originally, this website was hosted on https://drv.tw. This static website host generates a random URL you can't change. My plan was to host it on Netlify and get a more readable URL like this one: https://windify.netlify.app. This will also prevent the website from going offline if something happens to my Google Drive

### Why did I make this?

I made this website to try to trick my friends into believing I got Windows running on a Chromebook

### Will I ever come back to this project?

I may come back to this project if I get interested in this again.

### Can I use your code?

Yes, you can. You can fork this website and remake it. The source is very messy so do it at your own risk! Most of the site is not even compliant with W3 standards.

### How long did it take you to make this?

It took me about a week to finish the main part of the website.
