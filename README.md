### Why is it here?

Originally this website was hosted on https://drv.tw. This static website host generates a random URL you can't change. I moved it here to host it on Netlify and get a more readable URL, like the it has. Doing this would also prevent the website from going offline if something were to occur to my Google account.

### Will I ever come back to this project?

I will come back to this project if I get interested in this again.

### Can I use your code?

You can! It is very messy as this was the first site I ever built.

### How long did it take you to make this?

It took me about a week to finish the main part of the website.
