## This website has been deprecated. It is no longer maintained. This may mean the webiste may break in the future. You can access this website at [https://windify.netlify.app/](https://windify.netlify.app/)

### Why is it here?

Originally, this website was hosted on https://drv.tw. This static website host generates a random URL you can't change. My plan was to host it on Netlify and get a more readable URL like this one: https://windify.netlify.app. This will also prevent the website from going offline if something happenes to my Google Drive

### Why did I make this?

I made this website to try and trick my friends into beliveing I got Windows running on a Chromebook

### Will I ever come back to this project?

I may come back to this project if I get interested in this again.

### Can I use your code?

Yes, you can. You can fork this website and remake it. The html I used is using outdated methods and is messy. Most of the site is no longer supported by W3 standards.

### How long did it take you to make this?

It took me about one week to finish the main part of the website.
